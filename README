Build 
------------------
- if your machine (i.e. robot) has its clock set wrong (like most of ours)
  you'll want touch all the files to fix clock skew and ensure a complete 
  build:

     # find . -exec touch {} \;

- then build:

     # make


Install 
--------------------
- to install everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) in /usr/local/player (you need to be root, of course):

      # make install

  the executable server itself will install as /usr/local/player/bin/player.

- if you want to install somewhere else, change INSTALL_PREFIX in Makefile

Uninstall
--------------------
- to uninstall everything (server binary, client libraries and headers,
    and examples) from /usr/local/player (you need to be root, of course):

      # make uninstall

Clean
--------------------
- to clean up (remove all binaries, etc.).  doesn't uninstall from
    the system.

      # make clean
